Object Detection & Counting, Pose Analysis and Traffic Sign Detection Using COCO And Cityscapes Dataset

  This project handles object detection, counting of objects, instance and sematic segmentation of objects, pose analysis to identify the activities like walking, 
talking and dancing and traffic sign detection. The applications range from medical report analysis to self-driving autonomous vehicles. These applications become 
integral part of our day-to-day life and in almost all industries. So, it is essential that AI Engineers know all the nuances of using appropriate pre-trained models, 
fine tuning the models with the data sets for the tasks at hand. 
COCO and Traffic signs data set (built on Cityscapes data set) of images and videos of 50 different classes (like person, 
animals, bird, cars etc.).

This is a streamlit application. To run this code,

1. Copy all files in your current directory.
2. Download streamlit
3. pip install requirements.txt
4. Run the bash command 'streamlit run app.py'
5. Streamlit web app will open in your loclhost and ask to select options like 'Object Detection', 'Pose Analysis' etc. It accepts images and videos in mp4 format.
6. The files you provide as input should be in same directory as app.py, detect_objects.py etc.

The web app is already deployed in huggingface personal space and can be accessed via,
